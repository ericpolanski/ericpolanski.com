              <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
                I began my academic career at the College of Lake County, where I completed 56 credits toward a bachelorâ€™s degree with a 3.9 GPA, receiving a certificate of Academic Distinction. 
                During my time there, I founded the Chess Club and served as Student Government President, leading initiatives that improved campus life and being recognized as the most influential student on campus.

              <p> 
                In 2023, I transferred to Northwestern University to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. 
                At Northwestern, I immerse myself in rigorous, but fascinating, coursework, serve on the Computer Science Advisory Council, and have become a mentor for the Computer Science Peer Mentor Program.

                In my free, you'll find me engaging in a variety of activities that keep me balanced and inspired. 
                I love to travel, explore new cultures, and immerse myself in different environments. 
                Whether it's hiking in the mountains or relaxing on a beach, I find joy in nature's beauty. 
                I'm also an avid reader, always seeking new perspectives and ideas through books.
